**TunePulse** is an upcoming open-source firmware designed to:

- Control a wide range of motors (`DC`, `STEPPERS`, `BLDC`, `PMSM`, `LINEAR`)
- Operate across various control modes (`CLOSED-LOOP`, `FOC`, `POSITION`, `SPEED`, `TORQUE`, etc.)
- Feature compatibility with multiple interfaces (`STEP-DIR`, `UART`, `I2C`, `CAN/CAN-FD`, `USB`)
- Support various protocols (`GCODE`, `KLIPPER`, etc.)

Its primary goal is to advance the development of closed-loop systems and simplify their integration into existing 32bit MCU applications.

> **Note**: This firmware is under active development and currently lacks documentation.

## Getting Started

To get started with **TunePulse**, ensure you have the required Rust tools installed:

```bash
rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
cargo install flip-link
```

For using the rtt plotter, you will need a downgraded version of probe-rs. To get it run the following commands:

```
rustup default 1.79.0
cargo update
cargo install probe-rs --locked --features cli --version 0.21.1 --force
```

After that, you can upgrade rust to the latest version or perfered version again.

For additional setup instructions, see the [Probe.rs Installation Guide](https://probe.rs/docs/getting-started/installation/) and [Probe Setup Guide](https://probe.rs/docs/getting-started/probe-setup/#st-link).

1. Connect the ST-Link port to your computer and run the updater downloaded from the official ST-Link website.
2. Plug the controller into the programmer's single port and flash the blink example for testing:

```bash
cargo flash --release --package blink --chip STM32G431CBTx
```

After flashing, the controller should cycle through the Red, Green, and Blue LEDs.

**Optional**: Install the [Probe.rs Debugger extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=probe-rs.probe-rs-debugger).

## Flashing

1. Connect your computer to the ST-Link port on the programmer.
2. Connect the controller to the programmer's single port.
3. Run the following command to flash main firmware to CLN17 V2:

```bash
cargo run --package app
```

or this if you whant to get access to debug messages (tested on Windows PowerShell)

```bash
$env:DEFMT_LOG = "debug"; cargo run --package app
```

## Tools

### RTT Plotter

If you want to use the RTT plotter, you can find it in the `tools/plotter` directory. It runs off of a seprate workspace so it can be compiled on a host platform. You will need to edit the `.cargo/config.toml` file in the `tools/plotter` directory to match your host platform. Then you can run the `cargo run` command to start the plotter.

## Key Principles of Firmware Development

1. **Non-blocking Operation**: Avoid the use of `delay` and other blocking functions to ensure maximum performance for secondary systems.
2. **Interrupt-driven Telemetry Updates**: System telemetry is updated at fixed periodic intervals using interrupts, reducing the need for frequent checks and ensuring predictable, high-speed operation.
3. **Data Normalization**: Normalize data wherever possible to minimize the need for additional checks.
4. **Integer/Fixed-point Arithmetic**: Use integer or fixed-point mathematics wherever feasible, avoiding significant overhead, to maintain high performance across all controllers.
5. **Optimized Computations**: Minimize type conversions and optimize calculations for efficiency.
6. **Modular Design**: Divide the system into fundamental functional blocks whenever possible for better maintainability.
7. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep mathematical operations, algorithms, and hardware drivers in distinct parts of the codebase to enhance clarity and modularity.
